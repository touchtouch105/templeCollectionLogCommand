# Temple Collection Log Info
Gives access to the !log command to pull data from the Temple OSRS API

### Notes:
- In order to pull valid collection log data for your character, your collection log must be synced using the Temple OSRS plugin
### Toggleable Features:
- !log [coll log entry name]
- !log bosses (spammy)
- !log minigames (spammy)
- !log other (spammy)
- !log clues (spammy, note this is only for the base !log clues, !log clues hard etc still works)
- !log all (hilariously spammy, may crash your chat)



### Credits
Shoutout to the original collection log plugin creator who inspired me to do this
